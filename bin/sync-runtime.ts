// The github substrate VENDORS a copy of the GENERIC runtime under packages/substrate-github/src/runtime/
// so compileGithub can inject it into EVERY installation. The mirror holds only substrate machinery —
// the thin credentialed skill runner (claude-agent-run.ts + agent.ts), the model-proxy mint/exchange/
// revoke clients, the visual-verify helper, and the runner. The canonical source is scripts/ (where it is
// developed + tested) and the mirror tracks it.
//
//   bun bin/sync-runtime.ts            re-sync the mirror (scripts/ -> packages/.../runtime/)
//   bun bin/sync-runtime.ts --check    verify they match (CI); nonzero exit on drift
//
// EXCLUDED from the mirror (so they do NOT leak into every profile's install):
//   - DEV_ONLY: open-autonomy's own dev/analysis tooling (scaffold/bootstrap/proof/testbed/bench) —
//     never shipped into any installation.
//   - PROFILE_OWNED: the self-driving PROFILE's own agents (pm/reviewer/planner/strategist + their
//     deterministic libraries). These are profile content, not substrate runtime — they live in
//     profiles/self-driving/scripts/ and ship only via that profile's `resources`. Vendoring them here
//     is exactly the leak that put OA's PM/reviewer into an unrelated profile's install.
//   - CODE_HOST_RESOURCE: the gate scripts behind the carried CI workflows (merge / human-approval /
//     security). Code-host behavior, not substrate machinery — each profile whose workflows call one
//     carries it in `resources:` (byte-identical across profiles; check:profiles enforces), so the
//     mirror must not ALSO ship it into every install. docs/CODE_HOST_RESOURCES.md owns the ruling.
