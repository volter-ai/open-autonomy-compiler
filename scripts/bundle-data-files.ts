// The ONE declaration of the sibling DATA files the published `dist/cli.js` bundle reads at runtime via
// import.meta.url (the runtime backends, the runner frontend, the github runtime mirror, the egress guard).
// Single source of truth, imported by BOTH:
//   - scripts/build-cli.ts — copies each into dist/ next to the bundle (and statically asserts they landed);
//   - bin/doctor-checks.ts — check 1 (self) asserts each is present + readable beside the running bundle,
//     so a forgotten data file is a doctor FAIL by construction, not a list that can silently drift from the
//     build's own manifest (the OA-18 skeptic-panel PROOF FIX 7).
// PURE MODULE — no side effects at import time (it is pulled into the CLI bundle and into build-cli.ts).
