# Open Autonomy — working notes (canonical entry point)

> **Read this before touching anything.** This repo is **spec-first**: the design is written down in
> `docs/` and that is the source of truth. Do **not** reverse-engineer the model from code — find the
> owning doc in the directory below and read it first, then read the code. Most "surprises" in this
> codebase are answered by a doc you haven't opened yet.

## What this is

Open Autonomy is the **system + spec for autonomous software organizations** ("org-as-code"). You write a
**profile** (an `autonomy.ir.v1` IR describing actors, capabilities, triggers, policy), and
`compile(profile, substrate)` materializes a running installation onto a **substrate** (GitHub Actions, or a
local termfleet loop). This repo **dogfoods itself**: its own `main` *is* an installation of
`profiles/self-driving`. See `docs/VISION.md` (the why) and `docs/PROJECT.md` (the charter).

## Working agreement

- **Never wait for human approval on routine work. Push and merge; act with full agency** on any
  non-destructive, authorized change (commit to `main`, push, merge, deploy the proxy). Report what you did.
  **Develop directly on `main`** — never branch.
- **Spec-first, not code-first.** When something is unclear, open the owning doc (directory below) before
  grepping. I have repeatedly wasted effort by reverse-engineering what a doc already states.
- **`live proof` is the only proof.** A real run (testbed/dogfood) is what makes a feature "done"; unit tests
  and piecewise verification don't. Confirm CI is actually green — local-green can lie (ambient `node_modules`).
- **Distinguish DESIGNED vs BUILT.** Many capabilities are fully *specified* in `docs/` but only *partially
  built* (esp. the human seam — see "Built vs designed" below). Don't claim something exists because a doc
  describes it; don't rebuild something because you didn't find it in code. Check both layers.

## Scripts only for security — never script what an agent can do

The default executor is an **agent**, not a script. LLMs adapt; scripts can't. A deterministic script is
justified by **one thing only: security** — a boundary an agent must not control (minting/scoping run tokens,
the no-self-merge merge boundary, capability/permission enforcement, the repo-pause kill-switch, the
`human-approval` gate). Everything else — judgment, triage, decomposition, conflict resolution, "noticing" —
belongs to an agent. **Never script what an agent could do**; a missed action self-corrects next run. An
agent mistake is a **prompting or tools problem**, not a model-capability one — the fleet runs on DeepSeek v4
fast (stronger than last-gen frontier), so fix the prompt/tool, never route around the model. (Mirror in
`profiles/self-driving/AGENTS.md` for the fleet.)

## Directory — where everything lives (and what is authoritative)

### `docs/` — the spec layer (SOURCE OF TRUTH; read these first)

| Doc | Owns (authoritative for) |
|---|---|
| `docs/SPEC.md` | **The standard** (`autonomy.ir.v1`) — the one spec doc. Six sections: the IR (actor unit, four slots, four catalogs, conformance); **Capabilities** + **the merge boundary** (code:propose vs code:review; no agent merges); **Trigger params** (`subject.ref`, …); **Task lifecycle** (open→ready→…→done; "done is verified, not presumed"); **The Runner** (launch/list/get/update/cancel + the human realization); **Handoffs** (choreography over `tasks`, the typed seam, the human seam + its 4 affordances, simulators, the planned `maintainer` `kind:human` migration). Link sections by anchor, e.g. `docs/SPEC.md#capabilities`. |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | The master map + the doc index + the **canonical vocabulary** glossary + source-repo layout (absorbed PROJECT-LAYOUT). Start here for orientation. |
| `docs/VISION.md` | Mission, merit criteria, the three pieces (Standards/Bench/Dogfood), horizons **H1–H5**. |
| `docs/CONSTITUTION.md` | North star + the 7 operating rules (human-owned; amended, never auto-edited). |
| `docs/PROJECT.md` | Charter (the mission-as-charter; shipped to installs). |
| `docs/ROADMAP.md` | Dormant lane pointer; the phase record is `docs/history/phase-record.md` |
| `docs/standards/*.md` | code / docs / tests / security standards agents must follow. |
| `docs/OPERATIONS.md` | Operating OA: local quickstart · GitHub production rollout · release process (absorbed LOCAL-QUICKSTART / PUBLIC_AGENT_PRODUCTION_ROLLOUT / RELEASE). |
| `docs/OSS_AGENT_RUNBOOK.md` | Field runbook: local checks, live smoke tests, operator commands. |
| `docs/LIVE_TESTING_STRATEGY.md`, `docs/PROOF_LEDGER.md` | How the live testbed proves features (eval doctrine); the machine-parsed proof ledger (`check:proof`). |

> `SPEC.md` is the consolidation of the former AUTONOMY-IR / CAPABILITIES / TRIGGER-PARAMS / TASK-LIFECYCLE /
> RUNNER / HANDOFFS docs (one tightly-coupled spec: the IR + its four catalogs + the seam/runner). The table
> is the index so you never have to guess which doc to open. `CONSTITUTION`/`VISION` anchor everything.

### `packages/` — the engine (substrate-neutral core + substrate compilers)

- **`packages/core/`** — the IR + the contract. `ir.ts` (types, `validateIR`, the merge-boundary checks),
  `runner.ts` (the Runner contract + `ExecRunner` for agents + **`HumanRunner`** — parks a human task, never
  auto-completes, external act marks done), `manifest.ts`, `upgrade.ts` (**`INSTALL_OWNED_PATHS`**, upgrade =
  re-compile + prune), `conformance.ts`, `materialize`/`compiledPaths`.
- **`packages/substrate-github/`** — **`emit.ts`** compiles the IR → GitHub workflows: the agent job wrapper,
  the **capability→permissions** map, the **effect step** (push branch → PR → arm auto-merge → dispatch
  ci+agent-review+human-approval, all retried), the control plane, the harden-runner egress lockdown, the
  model-token mint/revoke. `isHuman` → **declared, not job-realized**. `runner.ts` = `GithubRunner`
  (agent-only). **`src/runtime/`** = the vendored mirror of `scripts/` injected into installs.
- **`packages/substrate-local/`** — the termfleet/local substrate. Unlike GitHub, it **runs a scheduler loop**
  (`scheduler/run.mjs` ticks → calls runners per kind), so the local substrate is where `HumanRunner` is
  actually driven.

### `profiles/self-driving/` — the dogfood org (compiles to this repo's root)

- `ir.yml` — the **roster** (pm, draft, develop, reviewer, planner, strategist, strategy_reviewer, and the
  `kind: human` maintainer), their `kind`, capabilities, crons, review gates; the **policy box**
  (`risk.human_required_paths`/topics, merge rules, `maintainer_block_labels`, planner label prefixes,
  `tracker.ztrackPreset`); the **`resources:`** list (files carried verbatim).
- `skills/<agent>/SKILL.md` — each agent's doctrine (prose behavior).
- `.open-autonomy/` — compiled `autonomy.yml`, `roadmap.yml` (the two-layer roadmap), `review-rubric.yml`,
  `strategy-rubric.yml`, `strategist-sources.json`.
- `.github/workflows/` — hand-written profile workflows: `human-approval.yml`, `security.yml`,
  `security-gate.yml`, `merge.yml`, `open-autonomy-preflight.yml` (the per-agent `develop.yml`/`pm.yml`/…
  are **generated**, not here; `ci.yml`/`codeql.yml`/`deploy.yml` are REPO-owned since the U5 sdlc rebase —
  they live only at root, not in the profile).
- `AGENTS.md` — fleet-facing guidance (the agent-doctrine mirror of this file).

### `scripts/` + `bin/` — the runtime backend + CLIs

- **`scripts/`** = the runtime backend, **mirrored** into `packages/substrate-github/src/runtime/` via
  `bun bin/sync-runtime.ts` (enforced by `check:runtime-sync`). Groups: agent execution
  (`claude-agent-run.ts`, `agent.ts`, `transcript.ts`), model-token lifecycle
  (`model-proxy-mint/exchange/revoke.ts`), deterministic gates/sweeps (`reconcile-merged-issues.ts`,
  `rearm-auto-merge.ts`, `human-approval-gate.ts`), and dev-only/profile-owned tooling (NOT mirrored:
  `bench-*.ts`, `rotate-admin-token.ts`, `open-autonomy-upgrade-cli.ts`, `*.test.ts`).
- **`bin/`** — `autonomy-compile.ts`, `check-dogfood.ts`, `sync-runtime.ts`, `autonomy-upgrade.ts`,
  `autonomy-conformance.ts`, `bench.ts`.

### The model proxy — lives in `volter-ai/open-autonomy` (the platform repo), not here

The **OA treasury** (`@open-autonomy/treasury`): the economy layer that **gates all agent model spend**,
holds the funding-account tree, exposes the **generic supplier API** (registry + itemized consume +
two-phase reserve/settle + per-supplier exposure caps — see its README "Suppliers"), and serves the funding
storefront (open-autonomy.org).
`src/`: `index.ts` (routes + `x-admin-token` admin), `anthropic.ts`/`openai.ts`/`pricing.ts` (provider
routing; deepseek/* via OpenRouter settles **cheap**, ~cents), `run-budget.ts` + `limit-ledger.ts` (Durable
Objects: per-run + global spend ledger, run slots, accounts/suppliers, profiles, `recent_runs`),
`supplier.ts` (supplier vocabulary + credentials), `github-sync.ts` (syncs a repo's
profile + roadmap rollup), `platform-html.tsx`/`project-docs.tsx`/`ui/` (server-rendered funding page).
Deploy with `bunx wrangler deploy`. **The proxy ledger's `consumed_usd_cents` is the authoritative cost — NOT
the CLI's `total_cost_usd`** (which mis-prices proxied models ~40×).

**Reviewer doctrine for this surface (repo-local — U5 rebase note, supercode study §II.8.1 row 6):** this
paragraph used to live inside `profiles/self-driving/skills/reviewer/SKILL.md`; it moved here because it is
this repo's own operational knowledge (proxy auth/admin/funding), not something that should template onto an
adopter's install of the self-driving profile. It still reaches the `reviewer` agent's context the same way
this whole file does (every session in this repo loads `CLAUDE.md`), so nothing was lost by moving it —
**security-critical paths get the higher bar — scrutiny, not an automatic stop.** Any change to the model
proxy's auth/admin (`AGENT_PROXY_ADMIN_TOKEN`), OIDC/JWKS validation, HMAC verification
(`AGENT_PROXY_HMAC_SECRET`), spend-cap (`MAX_*`) enforcement, or the funding ledger demands real rigor: a
plausible-looking logic flip there (a `||` that should be `&&`, an off-by-one in a bound, the wrong field
compared) is the costliest miss and the hardest to see — so **fail** if you can't confidently verify it's
correct. But don't reflexively mark it `human-required`: merging proxy code is inert (it doesn't deploy), and
the human checkpoint already lives at the gated deploy (below). Review it on the merits and pass if sound, so
the fleet can iterate on the proxy autonomously.

### `bench/` — the eval harness

Disposable funded testbed cells (`profile × substrate × workload`). `bun bin/bench.ts` →
`--live`/`--drive`/`--operate`/`--score`/`--teardown`. Human actors are simulated here (fixtures), which is
why human simulation is a precondition for Bench.

---

## The mental model (concise; depth in the docs above)

- **Unit = an actor** with `kind: agent | human` and four slots: behavior, capabilities, triggers, config.
  `kind` is **declared in the profile**; *realization* (script / model / real person / simulator) is the
  substrate's choice. (`SPEC.md#the-ir`, `SPEC.md#handoffs`)
- **Handoffs = choreography over `tasks`.** Actors don't call each other; they change a task's state and the
  next actor's trigger fires. `agent:launch` (the Runner) is the direct-dispatch escape hatch. (`SPEC.md#handoffs`)
- **Triggers:** `cron` + `dispatch` are portable; `event:` is the substrate-native escape hatch.
- **Capabilities → the merge boundary:** `code:propose` (contents:write — push/PR) and `code:review`
  (statuses:write — post `agent-review`) are **never on one agent**; no agent gets `code:merge`. Native
  auto-merge lands a PR once required checks pass. (`SPEC.md#capabilities`)
- **Substrates** realize the same IR differently (GitHub = events+workflows, no Runner loop; local =
  scheduler+runners). Realization is the substrate's job; the profile is substrate-agnostic.

## Editing shared control files (the three layers)

`profiles/self-driving/` is the SOURCE of this repo's github installation. There is no hand-maintained
template — the installation is `compile(profiles/self-driving, github)`.

1. **Profile (compiled to root):** skills (`.codex/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`), generated workflows
   (`.github/workflows/<agent>.yml`), `.open-autonomy/autonomy.yml`, profile `docs/*`. **Edit the file under
   `profiles/self-driving/`**, then regenerate root with `bun scripts/open-autonomy-upgrade-cli.ts` (or
   `bun bin/autonomy-compile.ts`). **Never hand-edit a generated copy** — `check:dogfood` will fail.
2. **Runtime (substrate-owned):** `scripts/*` — edit + test in `scripts/`, then `bun bin/sync-runtime.ts`
   to refresh the vendored mirror; `check:runtime-sync` enforces they match. `compileGithub` injects it.
3. **Repo-owned / install-owned** (`INSTALL_OWNED_PATHS` in `packages/core/src/upgrade.ts`): `package.json`,
   `bun.lock`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.open-autonomy/roadmap.yml`, `docs/CONSTITUTION.md`,
   `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/PROJECT.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` — **and this
   `CLAUDE.md`**. Seeded once, never overwritten by upgrade; edit directly. `services/*` is also repo-owned.

```
bun bin/autonomy-compile.ts profiles/self-driving github <dir>   # produce an installation
```

`check:dogfood` enforces OA root == `compile(profiles/self-driving, github)` for every managed file. Upgrade
is a re-compile (`packages/core/src/upgrade.ts`): regenerate derived, seed install-owned only if missing,
prune derived orphans. Run locally via `scripts/open-autonomy-upgrade-cli.ts`; it is a maintainer command,
not an autonomous agent (it can touch `.github/workflows`, a human-required path).

## Build / checks

`bun run check` runs all gates: `check:autonomy` (tsc), `check:core`, `conformance`, `check:runtime-sync`
(scripts == mirror), `check:compile` (profile compiles), `check:profiles`, `check:dogfood` (root == compile),
`check:provision`, `check:public-agent` (scripts tests+tsc), `check:agent-proxy` (the worker —
**installs its own deps first**, since it's a standalone package), `check:proof` (roadmap proof gates).
A standalone package outside the `packages/*` workspace must install its own deps in its check, or CI breaks
while local stays green.

## Load-bearing invariants / gotchas

- **No agent merges.** Branch protection on `main` requires `ci` + `agent-review` + `human-approval` status
  checks; the permission split is the boundary. `enforce_admins: false` → only human admins can direct-push
  (agents are forced through gated PRs); "require PR before merging" is on.
- **GITHUB_TOKEN anti-recursion:** a bot-opened PR does NOT fire `pull_request`/`pull_request_target`
  workflows — so `ci`, `agent-review`, and `human-approval` are **dispatched explicitly** by the proposer's
  effect step (with retries). Forget the dispatch → the required check never posts → the PR wedges.
- **`human-approval` gate** (`scripts/human-approval-gate.ts` + `.github/workflows/human-approval.yml`):
  ADDITIONAL required check. Routine PRs auto-pass (no human); PRs in `human_required_paths` scope or carrying
  the `human-required` label need a **maintainer Approve on the current head SHA** (per-SHA re-earn).
- **Cost authority:** the proxy ledger's `consumed_usd_cents` is real; the CLI `total_cost_usd` is a wrong
  estimate for proxied models. deepseek-v4-flash runs cost **cents**; the binding per-run cap is
  `--max-requests`, not `--max-usd-cents`.
- **Run slots leak** if a job dies after mint before revoke; auto-reaped at token TTL (~2h). Revoke is retried
  + non-fatal.
- **Roadmap status is DERIVED** from child issues (`roadmap:<id>` labels), never hand-written. Two layers:
  strategist writes/retires layer-1 intents; planner converts to issues (layer-2). A `DIRTY`/conflicting PR
  never auto-merges even when green — the PM must re-develop it.

## Built vs designed (so we stop conflating)

- **Built:** the IR + actor model (core); `HumanRunner` (core — the substrate-neutral reference semantics,
  `packages/core/src/runner.test.ts`); the merge boundary; the two-layer roadmap + strategist audit/retire +
  planner reap; the `human-approval` gate (github realization of the human *review* handoff, enforced).
- **Built (the human seam, H1 — github realization, live-proven):** `human_required` is now a **declared
  consumer**, not a bare flag — a `maintainer` `kind:human` actor (`profiles/self-driving/ir.yml` +
  `skills/maintainer/SKILL.md`; declared in the manifest, no job emitted). The github *engage* is
  github-native (the gh runner owns its engage): the `human-approval` gate **assigns + requests-review** from
  the maintainer(s) (`PUBLIC_AGENT_MAINTAINERS`, fallback owner) → GitHub notifies them out-of-band; the PM
  (Step 2c) **engages + escalates** human-required/needs-info/blocked items on the SLA
  (`policy.box.human.sla_minutes`); and the seam **resumes** on the authorized `out` — a maintainer Approve,
  or `/agent decide|answer` (control plane; runs once via the `ISSUE_CONTROL_PRIMARY` control job). The manifest
  serializes `kind: human` (no `workflowFile`) and round-trips the `dispatch` trigger.
- **Built (the human seam — LOCAL realization, live-proven, BL-28):** the local runner now DRIVES the human
  route directly — `packages/substrate-local/src/runner-frontend.ts`'s `launch()` PARKS a session for a
  `kind: human` actor (never executes/watches one), matching `HumanRunner`'s semantics (note field,
  never-auto-completes) but reimplemented inline (not imported — the file ships verbatim into every
  install with no dependency on `@open-autonomy/core`). `engage` = print to console + append to the
  well-known `.open-autonomy/runner-state/human-attention.md`, plus an optional operator-configured
  `AUTONOMY_HUMAN_ENGAGE_CMD` command hook (receives the session as JSON on stdin) for Slack/email/paging —
  black-box, never required. The runner CLI now implements all five contract verbs
  (`launch|list|get|update|cancel`; `get`/`update` are new) — for a human session they operate on the
  local park-file directly, and for a termfleet session they delegate straight to the backend
  (`packages/substrate-local/src/backend.mjs`), which already implemented `get`/`update`. `list <actor>`
  surfaces parked (running) human sessions alongside live termfleet ones and pending propose effects, so a
  PM's WIP/dedup + escalate-on-SLA doctrine can see an outstanding human ask. `compileLocal` excludes a
  `kind:human` actor from the schedule (even if it somehow carries a cron) and from launch prompts, but
  still copies its `SKILL.md` (the person's doctrine), mirroring compileGithub's choices exactly.
  `profiles/hello-human/` is the adopter-facing worked example (one script `requester` + a declared human
  `approver`); recipe in `docs/OPERATIONS.md`'s local-runner quickstart ("Human-in-the-loop on the local
  runner").
- **Still designed / NOT built:** the **distributional/model-roleplay human simulators** + the calibrated twin
  (H3/H4) and the **producing-side typed seam graph** (H4). The behavioral **escalate-on-SLA** is PM doctrine
  (proven live, not unit-tested — `emit.test.ts` keeps it as the one human-seam `test.todo`). A standalone
  **health monitor** (detect when the org/PM itself is down, so escalation can't depend on the PM) is the
  separate `operator-observability` gap (issues #66/#67).
