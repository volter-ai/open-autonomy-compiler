# The Autonomy Standard (`autonomy.ir.v1`)

> **This is the single spec doc.** It defines the standard a profile is written in: the **actor**
> unit, the **four catalogs** (capabilities, trigger-param sources, task lifecycle, config), the
> **Runner** control seam, and **handoffs** (choreography over tasks + the human seam). It was
> consolidated from six separate docs — AUTONOMY-IR, CAPABILITIES, TRIGGER-PARAMS, TASK-LIFECYCLE,
> RUNNER, HANDOFFS — which are now the sections below. Cross-references between them are intra-doc
> anchors. Strategy/why lives in `docs/VISION.md`; the rules in `docs/CONSTITUTION.md`.

**Sections**

1. [The IR](#the-ir) — the actor model, the four slots, the four catalogs, conformance.
2. [Capabilities](#capabilities) — the authority model + the merge boundary.
3. [Trigger params](#trigger-params) — the cross-substrate param-source vocabulary.
4. [Task lifecycle](#task-lifecycle) — the state vocabulary the orchestrator reads.
5. [The Runner](#the-runner) — the universal actor-control seam.
6. [Handoffs](#handoffs) — choreography over tasks + the human seam.

## The IR

`autonomy.ir.v1` — the standard.

> **Authoring tutorial:** [`profiles/README.md`](../profiles/README.md) — the practical, worked-example
> counterpart to this normative section (write your first `ir.yml`, the SKILL.md contract, the
> `policy.box` conventions). This section stays the source of truth on conflict.

> **Status:** finalized model; the codebase is being aligned to it. The terms `workflow`,
> `launch`, `run`, `raw`, `steps`, `box.model`, `skill|script`, `commit|propose` are **retired** — see
> "What this replaces" at the end. If the code still shows them, the code is mid-migration, not the spec.
>
> **Actor model (current):** the one unit is the **actor** (`kind: agent | human`). Triggers are
> `cron` | `event` | `dispatch` — the two PORTABLE kinds are `cron` (time) and `dispatch` (on-demand via
> the Runner, [§The Runner](#the-runner)); `event` is the substrate-native escape hatch. There is **no `task:`
> trigger**: a task is a work ITEM whose lifecycle state is a property the orchestrator READS when deciding
> what to dispatch ([§Task lifecycle](#task-lifecycle)), never a trigger the substrate watches.

### The shape of the whole thing

The IR is a **standard**. It concretely defines one unit (the *agent*) and four catalogs (capabilities,
trigger-param sources, task lifecycle, config keys). A **substrate** (`gh-actions`, `local`, …) — the agent **runner**, NOT
the code host — is a **partial implementation** of that standard, realizing the subset it supports its own way.
(`github` is a back-compat alias for `gh-actions`; it conflated the runner with the github code host — prefer
`gh-actions`. Runner ⟂ code host: see §"Runner vs code host" and `docs/CODE_HOST_RESOURCES.md`.) **Conformance** reports the support
matrix. It is exactly the relationship a web standard has to browsers: the spec is complete and concrete;
each implementation supports part of it; a profile using a feature works to the degree its target
supports it.

```
IR (the standard)        — what exists, precisely. Never how.
   ↓ compile(profile, substrate)
substrate (an impl)      — how, for the subset it supports. Declares the rest unsupported.
   ↓
installation             — what runs.
conformance              — the support matrix across substrates.
```

The core (the standard) **only validates spec-validity and wires** — it never interprets what a
capability *does*, where a trigger param is *sourced*, or what a config key *means*. The substrate is the
only thing that knows codex, `gh`, PRs, termfleet.

### The one unit: an actor (agent or human)

There is no `workflow`, no `launch`/`run`/`raw`. There is one concept — an **actor** — with exactly four
slots. An actor has a **kind**: `agent` (a machine participant) or `human` (a person). The four slots are
identical for both; `kind` (the **role**) is **intrinsic and declared in the profile**, while
*realization* (how the role is filled — a script, a model, a real person, or a **simulator** in test) is
the substrate's/environment's choice. `kind: agent` is the default, so existing profiles are
unchanged. The slots:

```yaml
schema: autonomy.ir.v1
targets: [gh-actions, local]

# The top-level key is `agents:` TODAY (packages/core/src/ir.ts) — the rename to `actors:` described
# above is mid-migration and NOT yet accepted by the parser; `actors:` here fails with `invalid profile
# IR: no agents`. Compile this example verbatim once you see `agents:`.
agents:
  developer:                           # kind: agent (the default)
    behavior: developer               # what it does — a SKILL (prose); run as a credentialed job. Bare
                                       # name: both compilers resolve it under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
                                       # themselves — do NOT write `skills/developer` here (ENOENT).
    capabilities: [code:propose, tasks:converse]   # its authority (the standard's capability catalog)
    triggers:                          # when it fires; three forms — cron | event | dispatch
      - { dispatch: true, params: { ISSUE: subject.ref } }  # portable: launched on demand by the orchestrator
      - { event: issue_comment }                            # substrate-native escape hatch
    execution: { workspace: isolated } # a fresh workspace per launch; no implied PR lifecycle
    timeout: 30                        # a run-time bound (minutes)

  reviewer:
    behavior: reviewer
    capabilities: [code:review]
    result: { schema: open-autonomy.review.v1 }     # named standard result contract; inline JSON Schema is also valid
    triggers: [{ dispatch: true, params: { PR: subject.ref } }]

  maintainer:                          # kind: human — a person; intrinsic, not a substrate choice
    kind: human
    behavior: maintainer-review        # the task spec the person is handed (situation / decision /
                                       # result) — same bare-name rule as above: resolves to
                                       # `skills/maintainer-review/SKILL.md`
    capabilities: [tasks:converse, code:review]
    triggers: [{ dispatch: true }]     # engaged on demand when the orchestrator routes work to a person

  planner:
    behavior: planner
    capabilities: [tasks:author, tasks:converse]
    triggers: [{ cron: "17 6 * * *" }]

policy: { box: {} }                    # governance (merge/risk/…); substrate + agents read what they know
resources: [docs/standards/code.md]    # verbatim files; the standard never interprets them
```

| slot | what it is | who reads it |
|---|---|---|
| **behavior** | what the actor does — a SKILL (prose); a `kind: human` actor's is the task spec a person is handed | the substrate *realizes* it: `kind: agent` → a credentialed job runs the skill via a model; `kind: human` → a real person (prod) or a simulator (test) |
| **capabilities** | the actor's authority — from the capability catalog ([§Capabilities](#capabilities)); realized as the agent's own scoped token | the substrate realizes each as a permission on that token |
| **triggers** | when it fires + the **params** it forwards. Three forms: `cron` (time), the portable `dispatch` (on-demand via the Runner — [§The Runner](#the-runner)), and the substrate-native `event` | the substrate's trigger executor; `cron` and `dispatch` are portable, `event` is carried |
| **timeout** | optional run-time bound (minutes) | the substrate's job timeout |

Within its behavior contract, an actor may declare `result.schema`: either a named standard result contract
or an inline JSON Schema. This is the typed output of its behavior, not authority or runner configuration. The declaration
is preserved in the substrate-neutral manifest. A proposer review edge requires its reviewer to declare
`open-autonomy.review.v1`; substrates may realize that same result differently and must report unsupported
realizations honestly.

The standard review result separates three different effects: `changes-requested` is an agent-fixable
rejection; `approved` with `humanApprovalRequired: true` is sound code waiting on an independent approval
gate; and `human-required` is a parked task that MUST include a verified `humanTask` (`ask`, `assignTo`, and
`completion: { ac, via, check }`). A bare human-required flag is invalid because it names no work a person
can actually complete.

An actor also carries a **kind** (`agent` | `human`, default `agent`) — a discriminator, not a fifth slot.
`kind` (the role) is the profile's; *realization* (how the role is filled — model/person/simulator) is the
substrate's (see Kind/realization below). `policy`
(global governance) and `resources` (verbatim files) sit at the top level. That is the entire IR.

**The SKILL.md name==folder contract.** A non-script `behavior` (a bare name, e.g. `developer`) resolves
to `skills/<behavior>/SKILL.md`, and that file's frontmatter `name:` **must equal `<behavior>`** — both
harnesses launch a skill by that name (`/name` for Claude Code, `$name` for codex; a `kind: human`
actor's skill is the doctrine a person is handed, same rule). A mismatch compiles clean and then the
launch trigger never resolves. `validateSkillFrontmatterIn` (`@open-autonomy/core`) checks this at
compile time for any profile (`bin/autonomy-compile.ts`, and `bin/check-profiles.ts` for this repo's own
catalog) — before it was enforced only for profiles shipped in this repo.

### The four catalogs (the standard's concrete vocabulary)

A profile depends **only** on these named vocabularies, never on a substrate's raw shapes. New entries
are added to a catalog first, then implemented by substrates — purely additive, never a restructure.

1. **Capabilities** ([§Capabilities](#capabilities)) — the agent's *authority*, over three nouns (code · tasks ·
   agent): `code:propose` · `code:review` · `code:merge` (gate-only) · `tasks:author` · `tasks:converse` ·
   `agent:launch|list|update|cancel`. A capability IS a grant on the agent's own scoped token.
2. **Trigger param sources** ([§Trigger params](#trigger-params)) — what a trigger can forward to the agent:
   `subject.ref` · `subject.actor` · `subject.text` · `trigger.kind`. A trigger declares
   `params: { OPAQUE_NAME: source }`; the substrate resolves the source from its firing context.
3. **Agent fields** (no opaque config box) — closed, typed launch fields include:

   | field | meaning | github | local |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | `timeout` | minutes before kill | job `timeout-minutes` | runner kill-after |
   | `execution.workspace` | `shared` or a fresh `isolated` workspace; never an implied proposal | fresh job checkout | fresh unique git worktree |
   | `prelaunch` | an opaque shell command the runner runs in the session's own cwd, BEFORE it spawns (best-effort: a nonzero exit is logged, never fatal) | *(no realization yet — local-only for v1)* | `spawnSync(prelaunch, { shell: true, cwd })` before the session spawns |

   `prelaunch` is not a reintroduction of a config box — it is a single opaque DATA string with one
   documented realization (the runner executes it verbatim, never interprets it), the same shape as
   `review` naming a reviewer agent. It exists to arm optional session-local state (e.g. a marker file a
   session's own hooks read) that must exist *before* the session starts looking for it — something no
   agent's own skill prompt can do, since the skill only runs once the session has already spawned.
   Declared per-agent; absent ⇒ no-op (most agents declare none). See [§The Runner](#the-runner) for the
   full contract.

   There is **no** `config` box. Everything the box once carried is now either a capability (authority),
   substrate-DERIVED (the workflow filename = `<agent>.yml`; the model endpoint is provisioned for every
   skill agent), or simply gone (the trust/credential knobs — trust is the capability/permission split,
   below). The model budget is the bounded mint (a substrate concern, not an IR field). Substrate-specific
   github knobs (`workflowFile`/`persistCredentials`/`permissions`/`env`/`concurrency`) were leaks and are
   removed: a github permission set is *computed* from capabilities, never written in the IR.

4. **Task lifecycle** ([§Task lifecycle](#task-lifecycle)) — the states a work item can be in (`open` · `ready`
   · `working` · `in-review` · `input-required` · `blocked` · `done` · `rejected`). This is vocabulary the
   **orchestrator reads** off a work item to decide what to dispatch — **not** a trigger. A task's state is
   a property; the PM (on `cron`) reads it and `launch`es the matching worker (a `dispatch` agent). A
   **handoff** (a seam, [§Handoffs](#handoffs)) is a typed edge over these states — an upstream actor's work
   produces a transition the orchestrator observes and acts on. No substrate watches task state.

### Kind, realization, trust, review — orthogonal axes (only `kind` is in the IR)

This is the distinction that took the longest to get right, so it is stated explicitly:

- **Actor kind** (`agent` vs `human`) — the **role**: intrinsic, declared in the profile (the one of
  these that *is* an IR field — the `kind` discriminator). You cannot turn a human *role* into a permanent
  script; that would be a *different org design*. `kind` says *who* the actor is — a different axis from
  realization (*how* the role is filled).
- **Realization** (how the role is filled) — the **substrate's/environment's choice**, not in the IR. For
  `kind: agent`: a credentialed job runs the skill via a model. For `kind: human`: a **real person** in
  production, or a **simulator** in a testbed — *same profile, different environment*. Filling the same
  role differently per environment is what makes an org with human actors **testable** ([§Handoffs](#handoffs)).
- **Safety** (can a hijacked agent do harm?) — the **capability/permission split**. The agent acts with a
  token scoped to its capabilities; the one irreversible power — merge — is withheld from every agent
  (`code:review` = judge/bless, `code:propose` = push, never both), so no agent can land unreviewed code
  ([§Capabilities](#capabilities)). A substrate may realize a security-sensitive capability effect with a
  separate trusted finalizer, provided the agent still owns the judgment and the finalizer only validates
  binding/schema and publishes that result. Safety is capabilities + budget — not an IR trust field.
- **Change review** (does the resulting change get reviewed before merge?) — the `code:review` status +
  branch protection (`ci` + `agent-review` required); native auto-merge lands it.

### The substrate: a trigger executor + a runner, over a box

A substrate factors into two implementables over one shared environment:

1. **Trigger executor** — fires an agent when its triggers say so and forwards the declared `params`.
   Decides *when*. Only `cron` is portable; events are carried and fired where supported.
2. **Runner** — runs agents and manages their lifecycle (the Runner contract, below), launching each into
   a box.

over

3. **The box** — the environment an agent runs in: POSIX fs + shell + git + **a model endpoint** + the
   installed files. The model endpoint is **always** part of the box (a deterministic agent simply never
   calls it) — there is no "does it get a model" knob.

On **local** the two are separate (the loop fires; termfleet runs). On **gh-actions** one platform fills both
(Actions `on:` fires; the Actions job runs). An agent never sees the trigger executor — from its seat
there is only the runner and the box.

**Substrate config lives in the box, not the engine.** A substrate reads its installation config from
`policy.box.<substrate>` (e.g. `policy.box.gh-actions`: the model-proxy host, OIDC audience, model, bot git
identity — keyed by the runner name, not the github code host). The engine bakes in **no** org identity — a profile supplies these and the compiler emits them as
the install's `vars.*` defaults. Likewise `policy.box.risk.human_required_paths` is materialized **verbatim**
for the human-approval gate to enforce: the substrate *carries* policy, it never authors or augments it.

**Runner vs code host.** The substrate is the agent *runner* — where the fleet executes — and it is
orthogonal to the **code host** (github: where the repo lives and `ci` / `security` / `deploy` run). A
local-substrate org still has a github code host, so those CI/security/deploy workflows are **code-host
resources** carried by the profile (constant across runners, like the standards docs); only the per-agent
workflows are *generated* by the runner substrate. See `docs/CODE_HOST_RESOURCES.md`.

#### The Runner contract

The runner knows only **agents and their lifecycle** — no work, issues, or domain. `launch` carries
**opaque params** through to the agent (the system never interprets them; the agent's tooling does).

```ts
type SessionStatus = 'running' | 'paused' | 'cancelled' | 'done' | 'failed';
type LaunchParams = Record<string, string>;   // opaque pass-through
interface Session { id: string; agent: string; status: SessionStatus; ref?: string; params?: LaunchParams }

interface Runner {
  launch(agent: string, params?: LaunchParams): Session;            // C
  get(id: string): Session | undefined;                            // R (one)
  list(): Session[];                                               // R (running)
  update(id: string, patch: { status?: SessionStatus }): boolean;  // U
  cancel(id: string): boolean;                                     // D
}
```

The `agent:*` capability axis **is** this contract — an agent with `agent:launch` may launch others; the
operator always holds the full contract over a running agent (the control plane). Full detail in
[§The Runner](#the-runner).

**Workspace isolation is explicit and independent from proposal lifecycle.** A launchable skill agent may declare
`execution: { workspace: isolated }`; every launch then receives a fresh workspace (a local runner uses a
uniquely named git branch/worktree; a hosted job already has a fresh checkout). The equivalent one-off CLI
request is `--workspace isolated`; `--workspace shared` explicitly selects the ordinary checkout. This is
launch fencing only: it does not imply a PR, review, merge, work item, or branch-naming convention.

Separately, a caller may supply `--branch <name>` to join/create a particular isolated branch. That explicit
branch retains any profile/substrate proposal lifecycle attached to named work. The runner derives neither
form from a capability, role name, or work item, and injects no code-host identity: an agent that needs its
repo or PR resolves it through its own code-host tool. Thus `execution.workspace`, branch assignment, and
proposal publication remain three distinct contracts.

Local workspace ownership is recorded before creation and retained through uncertain launch.
A missing provider listing or an idle turn does not release a workspace. The supervisor
uses `runner.ts workspace-release <lease-id> --head <commit> --consumers-retired` after
retiring every consumer; this records release of that exact checkout generation and HEAD.
The cleanup path requires every peer lease to release, completed effects, clean state,
and matching Git identity. It preserves the exact commit and branch before ordinary Git
worktree removal. Legacy, malformed, interrupted and quarantined ownership stays visible
and fences cleanup; `runner.ts workspaces` reports it for owner recovery. A crashed
lock carries PID, process start identity and nonce; after the owner exits,
`runner.ts workspace-unlock <path> --nonce <recorded-nonce>` explicitly recovers it.
An interrupted unlock itself remains for manual inspection.

**`prelaunch` is a methodology-free pre-spawn hook, not a lifecycle stage.** An agent may declare an opaque
`prelaunch: <shell command>` (`IRAgent.prelaunch`, `packages/core/src/ir.ts`). Where realized, the runner
executes it in the session's own cwd — the worktree it is about to be launched into (or `process.cwd()` for
a trunk launch, no `--branch`) — **before** the session spawns, with the same env the session itself will
see. The runner treats it as **opaque data** the profile supplies: it never hardcodes a per-agent branch to
decide whether to run one, and it runs identically for any agent that declares a `prelaunch:` (a no-op for
every agent that doesn't — most agents declare none). This exists because a session's own tooling (its skill
prompt, its own Stop/SubagentStop hooks) only runs *after* the session has already spawned — too late to
arm state (e.g. a marker file) that tooling needs to see from its very first moment. It is **best-effort**:
a nonzero exit is logged and the launch proceeds anyway — a prelaunch arms optional session-local state, it
is never a gate on whether the session gets to run.

Realized today by the **local** substrate only (`packages/substrate-local/src/runner-frontend.ts`'s
`launch()`). gh-actions has **no realization yet** — deliberately deferred to a future change rather than
guessed at here: a plausible shape would be an extra pre-skill step in the generated per-agent workflow, but
that only pays for itself once a concrete gh-actions use case needs it. Declaring `prelaunch` on a profile
compiled only to `gh-actions` is accepted (validated for shape, carried into the manifest) but has no effect
there today — the same "declared, substrate may not implement it yet" posture as an unsupported capability
(see [§Conformance](#conformance--the-support-matrix)).

### What is NOT an agent

Not everything in an installation is an IR agent. Three kinds sit outside the standard:

- **Repo-owned files** (`ci.yml`, README, package.json, docs) — `resources`. The IR never models repo CI.
- **Substrate infrastructure** (github's model-proxy admin, the injected runtime, the control handler) —
  provided by the substrate, not declared in the profile.
- **Agents** (developer, planner, pm, reviewer, preflight, …) — the IR.

This is also why there is no `raw`: ingest maps a recognized agent to an agent, and anything else is a
repo-owned resource — never an escape hatch in the IR.

### Conformance — the support matrix

A substrate implements a **core** contract (required — any core-conformant substrate runs any IR) and an
**expanded** set it advertises. `bin/autonomy-conformance.ts` drives the real runner against its real
backend and reports `supported`/`unsupported` per feature — extended, under this model, to the whole
standard (capabilities, param sources, config keys), not just Runner ops. **Partial support is
first-class, not failure.**

**What `compile` warns on today (BL-22 dev/04 — minimal, not full feature-conformance):** `bin/
autonomy-compile.ts` warns when the substrate you're compiling ONTO isn't in the profile's own declared
`targets:` (e.g. `targets: [local]` but you ran `compile … gh-actions`) — the shallow, easy-to-derive
signal that a combination is unproven for this profile. There is still no GENERAL per-feature conformance
oracle (`compile` does not consult the conformance battery's per-feature matrix for arbitrary
feature/substrate pairs — that remains unwired). `open-autonomy lint <profileDir>` (BL-22 dev/04) runs the
same pre-materialize validation (parse + compile to every declared target + skill/folder-name check)
without writing anything, for a profile of your own.

**The one feature/substrate pair `compile` DOES check — event triggers on `local`.** `event` triggers are
the substrate-native escape hatch; a `local` install has no webhook listener to fire one. Before, an agent
whose only trigger was an `event` kind compiled clean onto `local` and then silently never ran — the exact
"declared, correct, and never invoked" failure this section warns against. `compileLocal`
(`packages/substrate-local/src/emit.ts`) now closes that one pair concretely, and does so by DELIVERING the
trigger where it can and ERRORING where it can't (a hard compile error, not a warning — silently dropping a
declared trigger is never acceptable):

- **Delivered** — the review edge. A `code:propose` agent names its reviewer via `review:` (the merge
  boundary's review edge). `compileLocal` emits `scripts/reconcile-open-reviews.mjs`, a polled reconciler
  (registered in `scheduler/schedule.json`) that dispatches that reviewer for any open agent PR whose head
  lacks the `agent-review` status — the local realization of the `issue_comment`/`pull_request_target`
  trigger a `gh-actions` install would fire natively. The reviewer AGENT is read from the compiled
  manifest (`agents.<proposer>.review`); only `agent-review` (a contract constant, see
  [Contract constants vs tunable policy](#contract-constants-vs-tunable-policy--which-names-belong-to-the-standard))
  is a literal.
- **Errored** — everything else. An agent whose entire trigger set is `event`-kind, with no portable
  `dispatch` trigger of its own, not named by any `review:` edge, and with no agent anywhere in the profile
  holding `agent:launch` (so no orchestrator could reach it another way either) has no local delivery path
  at all → `compileLocal` fails loud, naming the agent and the fixes (add a `dispatch`/`cron` trigger, make
  it a `review:` target, or compile onto `gh-actions`). This escape-clause set (dispatch / review-target /
  an `agent:launch` holder exists) is what keeps the check from false-positiving on a normal PM-dispatched
  worker whose `event` trigger is just the gh-actions realization of the PM's own `agent:launch`.

**Local-substrate robustness reconcilers.** `local` has no webhook re-fire, so `compileLocal` emits two
more polled reconcilers (same emit-not-resource category as the runner backend — they exist only because
of a `local`-runner gap, not code-host scaffolding constant across runners:
[CODE_HOST_RESOURCES.md](CODE_HOST_RESOURCES.md)), both gated on a `github` code host with a `code:propose`
agent and registered in `scheduler/schedule.json`:

- `scripts/reconcile-ready-branches.mjs` — propose-recovery. A `code:propose` session that finished (its
  commits landed on its `agent/*` branch) but whose propose effect never ran (the window was killed before
  any tick observed it) leaves a ready branch with no PR; this opens it.
- `scripts/reconcile-open-checks.mjs` — check convergence. Required status checks are dispatched once at
  propose time; if the head sha moves or the PR goes BEHIND under strict branch protection, nothing
  re-posts them. This re-dispatches the missing/stale checks (reading the required contexts from the code
  host's own branch protection, never a hardcoded list) and brings a BEHIND branch current first.

**Runner core (MUST):** `launch` / `list` / `cancel`, ids received (not invented), params passed verbatim.
**Trigger core (MUST):** fire `cron` and launch the agent. PM-on-cron is the universal dispatcher, so cron
alone yields a working fleet.
**Expanded (MAY):** `get`/`update`; enforce `maxConcurrent`/`timeout`/model-bounds/permissions; isolation;
event triggers; the operator control surface; the merge boundary (the capability/permission split +
native auto-merge). Honored where present, declared unsupported where not.

### Validation — by running it for real, not by tests

There are **no unit tests** of behavior. The only real confidence is running the actual app, with real
AI, on a real project. The conformance battery is the one deterministic harness (the substrate seam is
mechanical). Live-proven to date: the github agent wrapper (privilege-separated, OIDC-minted, trust
boundary intact) running a real codex agent end-to-end and opening a PR from a declared trigger param —
work resolved purely from `subject.ref`, no implicit event reach-in.

### What this replaces (and why)

| retired | replaced by | why |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow` as a separate noun | the **agent** (carries its own triggers) | "the system's entire knowledge is agents" |
| `launch` vs `run` | one agent; execution is the substrate's choice | the split manufactured leaks (issue-driven, always-publisher) |
| `raw` | agent, or a repo-owned resource | the IR is a standard; non-agents are files, not escape hatches |
| `steps` / an "ABI" of work/change/model | nothing — that logic lives in the agent's behavior | the IR must not know issues, PRs, or models |
| `box.model` / `skill` vs `script` | nothing — the box always has a model; execution is the substrate's | those leaked the box's execution model into the IR |
| `commit` / `propose` on capabilities | trust = substrate security (derived); review = policy | capabilities are pure authority |
| `agent` as the sole unit | the **actor** (kinds: `agent`, `human`) | a person is a first-class participant, not negative space |

Every future change is *filling in the standard* — a new capability, param source, config key, or
task-lifecycle state, plus a substrate realization. The four-slot **actor** (genus; kinds `agent` and
`human`) and the standard/implementation/conformance split are the invariant.

---

## Capabilities

The agent authority model.

A profile **declares** what each agent may do as substrate-agnostic capabilities. A capability is **not**
an instruction handed to a mediator — it **is a grant on the agent's own credential**. The substrate mints
the agent a credential scoped to exactly its capabilities, and the agent does its own reads and its own
writes **in-process**. Capabilities never name a substrate's resources (no `issue`, `pr`, `branch`,
`workflow`); they name only the universal things an agent acts on.

There are exactly **two guards**, and nothing else:

- **capabilities** — *what* the agent may do (its scoped credential).
- **budget** — *how much* it may spend (the bounded model token).

### The three nouns

An autonomy agent acts on exactly three things:

| noun | what it is | github | local (sketch) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **code** | the codebase under version control | the repo / branches | the working tree |
| **tasks** | units of work + their discussion | issues | a work-store |
| **agent** | the other agents + their lifecycle | workflow runs | the loop queue |

(`merge` is the tell: it's a version-control operation, so the noun is honestly **code**, not a vague
"artifact." That's substrate-agnostic at the *git* level — github and local are both git repos — not a
github leak.)

### The capabilities

| capability | meaning | github realization |
|---|---|---|
| `code:propose` | propose a change (write a feature branch, open a PR, queue auto-merge, dispatch CI) | `contents: write` + `pull-requests: write` + `actions: write` |
| `code:review` | **bless** a change for merge (produce the verdict that gates landing) | merge reviewer emits a bound result; trusted runner effect posts `agent-review` |
| `code:merge` | **land** a reviewed change onto the default branch | **never granted to anyone** — landing is native auto-merge (see the merge boundary) |
| `tasks:author` | create / update / label / set state of work | `issues: write` |
| `tasks:converse` | post comments / verdicts on work and changes | `issues: write` (comment scope) |
| `agent:launch` | start another agent | `actions: write` (dispatch) |
| `agent:list` | observe running agents | `actions: read` |
| `agent:update` | pause / resume / retry another agent | control plane |
| `agent:cancel` | stop another agent | `actions: write` + control plane |

`observe` (read the code and tasks) is **baseline** — every agent has it; it is not a declared
capability. Reads are bounded by the agent's sandbox + budget, never by a permission.

The `agent:*` axis is exactly the **Runner contract** (`core/runner.ts`: launch / list / update / cancel
over sessions) — the substrate-agnostic definition of the agent lifecycle ([§The Runner](#the-runner)).

**Scope (optional).** A capability may carry a resource scope: `code:propose@roadmap` = "propose changes
to roadmap files only" (the strategist's governance constraint, expressed as a scoped capability, not a
deterministic guard script). The constitution's `human_required_paths` / `topics` are the global
complement — the region **no** capability may ever reach.

### The trust model: agents are capability-scoped; merge is gated

The agent runs with authority **scoped to its capabilities**. Most effects are direct; a substrate may split
judgment from publication where atomicity is itself a security boundary. GitHub does this for a merge
review: the read-only model judges, and a trusted base-branch effect publishes only its schema-valid,
PR/SHA-bound result. The one threat that justifies the hard boundary is **prompt injection** via untrusted
input (issue bodies, fetched pages, fork diffs) reaching default-branch-affecting power:

> **The single hard boundary: an agent can never merge.** `code:merge` is never grantable to an agent.

Everything an agent *can* do is recoverable, because the substrate is configured so a hijacked agent cannot
reach `main`, workflows, or secrets:

- **branch protection** on the default branch blocks direct push (a feature-branch PR is the only way in);
- the github **`workflows` permission** is never granted, so `.github/workflows` can't be edited even with `contents: write`;
- merging requires **two status checks — `ci` + `agent-review`** — and no single agent can produce both (see below);
- the install holds **no secrets** (the model token is OIDC-minted and bounded — that is the budget guard).

So a fully-hijacked `code:propose` + `tasks:converse` agent can, at worst, push junk to a feature branch
or post a bad comment — both reverted in seconds, neither touching `main`. (This is a deliberate, small
relaxation of the old "agent holds nothing" model; the cost is recoverable feature-branch/comment noise,
the gain is that agents are real agents instead of envelopes passed to a mediator.)

#### The merge boundary — a permission split, no merge job

Landing on the default branch is gated by **two non-overlapping permission sets**, so no single agent can
land unreviewed code — and the merge itself is **GitHub native auto-merge**, not a token or an app:

- **`code:review`** — the authority to *bless* a merge. The reviewer judges a bound PR/head and emits the
  verdict; on GitHub, a separate base-branch effect validates that binding and posts `agent-review` last.
  The model job holds neither `statuses: write` nor `contents: write`, so it cannot publish early or merge.
- **`code:propose` = `contents: write`** — the authority to push a branch / open a PR / queue auto-merge.
  Proposers hold this and **not** `statuses: write`, so they can push but cannot self-certify a review.

Branch protection requires `ci` + `agent-review` (0 approvals — so there's no self-approval problem and no
app is needed). The proposer enables auto-merge when it opens the PR; **GitHub** lands it the instant both
statuses are green. Consequences:

- a hijacked **proposer** can't post `agent-review` → can never land anything the reviewer didn't bless;
- a hijacked **reviewer** has no status or content write token → can only return a review judgment for the
  PR/head the trusted setup bound before it ran;
- **no agent holds `code:merge`** — it isn't a token capability; the platform performs the merge.

`code:review` (bless) and the merge (perform) are deliberately separated; no agent holds both. The trusted
review effect is not another reviewer: it cannot invent merit, and only publishes a schema-valid result for
the bound current head. Its purpose is fail-closed atomicity, not model mediation.

#### The deploy boundary — the merge boundary's sibling, at the production edge

Merge guards what reaches `main`; **deploy** guards what reaches *production*, and the same principle holds
one step out: **no agent deploys.** Deploy is not an agent job and not a capability any agent holds — it is a
human-promoted, gated effect realized by the **code host** (github CI), independent of which substrate runs
the agents (a local-substrate org still deploys via its github repo — deploy is a code-host concern, not a
runner one). The realization:

- deploy fires only on a **human-cut promotion tag** (e.g. `deploy-v*`), restricted by repo ruleset to admins
  — the fleet's `contents: write` cannot create it;
- the deploy job runs in a **required-reviewer environment** (a maintainer approves each deployment;
  admin-bypass off);
- the deploy *workflow itself is a code-host resource* carried by the profile (like `ci.yml` — not engine
  output, see `docs/CODE_HOST_RESOURCES.md`), and the worst case is bounded **outside** the trust loop
  (provider-side spend caps + instant rollback), since the agents are funded by what they could deploy.

So merge and deploy are the two production boundaries: an agent may propose code and an agent may bless a
review, but **no agent lands on `main` and no agent ships to production** — each requires the human/native gate.

#### Contract constants vs tunable policy — which names belong to the standard

Two kinds of names cross the seam, and conflating them has produced both failure modes: hardcoding org
policy into substrate machinery (a runtime script shipping its own copy of an org's hold-label list into
every install), and the temptation to parameterize the seam itself (which would let one install silently
rename the thing every component must agree on).

- **Contract constants** — names independent components must agree on **at author time** for the seam to
  function: the proposer dispatches checks by name, branch protection requires them by name, the control
  plane applies/clears labels by name, the human gate reads them by name. They are part of `autonomy.ir.v1`'s
  realization; renaming one is a **spec change** coordinated across components, never a per-org knob.
  - status contexts: `ci`, `agent-review` (the merge boundary above), and `human-approval` — the
    additional required check shipped by gate-carrying profiles, re-earned **per head SHA**;
  - human approval result: a native current-head maintainer review or the exact-SHA
    `/agent approve <full-head-sha>` command; these are two GitHub realizations of the same declared human
    actor result, not two independent-human requirements;
  - labels: `human-required` and `agent-develop-only` (the human-approval gate's scope triggers),
    `agent-paused` (the control plane's pause-verb marker), `needs-info` and `agent-blocked` (the
    human-block labels the control plane's `decide`/`answer` resolutions clear);
  - the agent branch prefix `agent/`.
- **Tunable policy** — a `policy.box` parameter **with a reader** (a declared key nothing reads doesn't
  exist — `check:policy-consumers` makes that state unrepresentable): `merge.maintainer_block_labels`,
  `risk.human_required_paths`, `human.sla_minutes` / `maintainers_var`, the
  planner's label prefixes. Declared per profile, read at **runtime** from the compiled
  `.open-autonomy/autonomy.yml`; an org tunes them per install and no component changes.

The rule for a new name: **if a component must know it at author/compile time** (baked into a script, a
workflow expression, branch protection), it is a contract constant — record it here, export it as a code
constant where machinery needs the list (preflight seeds its expected labels from that export plus the
install's declared policy), and treat renames as spec changes. **If every consumer can read it at runtime
from the manifest**, it is policy — declare it under `policy.box` and wire the reader. One question decides;
both misfilings are bugs.

### The agent lifecycle (what replaced prepare / interpret)

```
provide            →     skill                    →     effect
(substrate hands the     (judges; emits result =        (capability realization;
 trigger's subject in)    intent in capability terms)    trusted only at security boundaries)
```

- **provide** — the substrate materializes the trigger's *subject* (a PR's diff+checks, an issue, …) into
  the sandbox. Generic; the only variable is which subject, declared by the trigger.
- **skill** — does the work and emits its typed `result`.
- **effect** — the substrate realizes the capability. Most actions are direct. Security-boundary effects may
  be finalized separately: GitHub validates/publishes the merge reviewer's bound result, the proposer queues
  auto-merge, and GitHub lands it.

There are no `prepare` / `interpret` scripts and no `config` hooks: "input gathering" is `provide`; "acting
on the result" is the agent using its own capabilities.

### github realization

The github substrate computes permissions from capabilities. Ordinary effects remain direct. For the
reviewer named by a proposer's `review:` edge, setup binds the PR/current SHA and invalidates stale green;
the runner waits for live required mechanical checks (excluding its own review context and any independent
human-approval gate), and only then mints the bounded model token and lets the read-only model write
`open-autonomy.review.v1`. A failed prerequisite allocates no model run and emits a bound
`changes-requested` result without model judgment. A separate base-branch job validates and persists the
effects, posting green last; a valid human task is recorded before its parked label. Missing output, model
failure, stale binding, or partial effects never produces a current-head green. Landing remains native
auto-merge gated by required checks.

`config.permissions` does not exist; gh permission blocks are *computed*, never written in the IR.

### The OA agents, declared in this model

| agent | capabilities |
|---|---|
| pm | `tasks:author`, `tasks:converse`, `agent:launch` |
| developer | `code:propose`, `tasks:converse` |
| reviewer | `code:review`, `tasks:converse` (returns the bound merge verdict; cannot merge) |
| strategy_reviewer | `code:review`, `tasks:converse` (blesses a roadmap proposal; cannot merge) |
| planner | `tasks:author`, `tasks:converse` |
| strategist | `code:propose@roadmap`, `agent:launch` |

No agent holds `code:merge`.

### What is NOT a capability

- **Observation** — baseline; reads are bounded by the sandbox + budget, not a permission.
- **Model access / budget** — the bounded model token (the budget guard), provisioned by the substrate; the
  IR declares the `budget`, not the credential.
- **Trust level** — not an IR capability. A trusted effect is a substrate implementation detail reserved for
  deterministic security boundaries; it cannot replace or reinterpret the agent's judgment.

## Trigger params

The cross-substrate contract.

A trigger fires an agent and **forwards params to it** — the producing end of the Runner contract's
`launch(agent, params)` (opaque `LaunchParams`). This is how an agent learns *what to act on* —
explicitly, from declared config, **never** by reaching into a substrate's implicit event context.

### The shape

In the IR, a trigger may declare `params`:

```yaml
triggers:
  - event: issues
    config: { types: [labeled] }
    params: { ISSUE: subject.ref }       # opaque name  ->  documented source
```

- **Param name** (`ISSUE`) — the profile's choice. **The core never interprets it**; it only wires it
  through to `launch(agent, params)`.
- **Source** (`subject.ref`) — drawn from the **documented vocabulary below**. Every substrate MUST be
  able to resolve each documented source from its own firing context.

The agent receives the resolved params (github: as job env; local: as `AUTONOMY_FORWARD` env) and its
**tooling** interprets them (`gh` on github, ztrack on local). The substrate's own runtime may also use
a resolved source for its realization (github fetches the `subject.ref` work item to bundle/PR it) — but
that is the substrate reading the *documented* source, not implicit event magic.

### The source vocabulary (every substrate must implement these)

| source | meaning | github resolves from | local resolves from |
|---|---|---|---|
| `subject.ref` | id of the work item that fired the trigger | `event.issue.number` / `event.inputs.issue_number` / `event.pull_request.number` | work-store item id |
| `subject.actor` | who initiated it | `event.sender.login` / `github.actor` | requester |
| `subject.actorRole` | the actor's authority over the project (for gating privileged commands); empty if N/A | `event.comment.author_association` (OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR/…) | requester's role |
| `subject.text` | the text that fired it (comment/body); empty if N/A | `event.comment.body` / `event.issue.body` | queued message |
| `trigger.kind` | why it fired | `event.action` / `event_name` | queue event kind |

A source a substrate cannot resolve for a given trigger resolves to empty — the agent's tooling decides
what to do with that. New sources are added here first, then implemented by each substrate; profiles
depend only on this vocabulary, never on a substrate's raw event shape.

### How github realizes it (reference)

`compileGithub` unions an agent's declared trigger params, resolves each source via the table above into
the `setup` and agent job env (keyed by the opaque param name), and the agent fetches its work item from
the `subject.ref` param via `gh` — replacing the old implicit `$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH` reach-in. The run id
is deterministic per run, so no params are threaded between jobs.

---

## Task lifecycle

The cross-substrate state vocabulary.

`tasks` is one of the three nouns ([§Capabilities](#capabilities)). The IR already models *authority over* tasks
(capabilities) and *triggers on* tasks (events), but it did **not** model the **state** of a task. This
catalog adds that — a small, portable set of lifecycle states — so a trigger or a handoff can name *the
state a task is in* without reaching into a substrate's raw events or label strings.

It is a catalog, peer to [§Capabilities](#capabilities) and [§Trigger params](#trigger-params): purely additive. The state lives in
the profile's **tracker** (a github issue, a ztrack item) and is **read by the orchestrator** — it is not
realized per substrate, because no substrate watches it.

### The states

| state | meaning |
|---|---|
| `open` | created, not yet triaged |
| `ready` | triaged, ready for an actor to work |
| `working` | an actor is acting on it |
| `in-review` | a change is proposed, awaiting review |
| `input-required` | blocked awaiting input from a named party (see below) |
| `blocked` | cannot proceed (policy / repeated failure / budget) |
| `done` | completed |
| `rejected` | terminal, not done (duplicate / spam / wontfix / failed) |

A profile maps these to its tracker's own state names (e.g. ztrack's `Ready` / `In Progress` /
`In Review` / `Done`); the orchestrator reads them there.

`input-required` carries a **from** in the seam (who must supply the input): `requester` (OA's existing
`needs-info`) or `maintainer` (OA's existing `human-required`). The state is portable; the *who* is part
of the handoff payload, not a separate state.

These are not new inventions — they consolidate vocabulary OA already uses (`needs-info`,
`human-required`, `agent-blocked`, and the stop-states in `ROADMAP.md`) into a portable set.

### How the orchestrator uses it

A task's state is a **property the orchestrator reads** — it is **not** a trigger. There is no `task:`
trigger and no substrate that watches task state ([§The Runner](#the-runner)). The dispatcher (the PM, on `cron`)
reads each work item's state off the tracker and `launch`es the matching worker (a `dispatch` actor)
through the Runner:

```
PM tick (cron) → read board → issue is `ready` → launch the developer (dispatch) with the item as --ref
```

This is why the lifecycle is portable without any substrate machinery: the only primitives the substrate
must provide are `cron` (time) and `launch` (the Runner) — both universal. The substrate-native `event:`
form remains as an escape hatch (partial-support is first-class — see [§The IR](#the-ir)).

### How a handoff uses it

A handoff (a **seam**, see [§Handoffs](#handoffs)) is a typed edge over this lifecycle: an upstream actor's
work *produces* a state transition; the orchestrator *reads* it and dispatches the downstream actor. The
lifecycle is the shared vocabulary that makes the producing and consuming ends name the same thing.

New states are added here first. A profile's skills depend only on this vocabulary (mapped to their
tracker's own states, e.g. ztrack), never on a substrate's labels or event names.

### Done is verified, not presumed

A task — agent or human — reaches `done` only when its **acceptance criteria (AC)** are *verified*, by a
**deterministic check and/or an AI-judge check** (the reviewer agent is OA's existing AI-judge for agent
work). There is **no `presumed-done` transition**: an elapsed timer or a sent notification never makes a
task `done`. A triggered task with no verified result is `pending` (or `blocked`/`failed`/escalated),
never `done` — otherwise a task with no result is silently counted complete.

This applies to humans too: a human is an untrusted, opaque actor (like a model agent), so the *claim*
"I did it" is validated by a check on the **effect**, not taken on faith. The check verifies the effect;
it cannot verify diligence (a human can rubber-stamp, an agent can be right by luck) — that residue is
covered by **accountability** (an attributable, on-record decision), not verification.

A human touchpoint is therefore exactly one of two things:

- **Verified task** — has an AC + check (deterministic and/or judge). Reliable outcome → it *can block*
  the flow (resume on verified done) → it *counts* as human work → it *reduces autonomy* (the org waited
  on a person). The resolution must be an **explicit, authorized act** (e.g. an `/agent approve` command
  gated by `subject.actorRole`, or a native review) — a closed loop, not a value inferred from prose.
- **Notification** — no AC (`presumed-done`). No reliable outcome ⇒ it is **fire-and-forget**: it *must*
  be non-blocking, must *not* be counted as completed work, and does *not* reduce autonomy. This is a
  legitimate, declared mode — "as good as a notification" — you just may not pretend it is more.

The **ask type** decides which is required: `inform` → notification (no AC); `do` / `decide` / `approve`
→ outcome required → AC + check mandatory. The forbidden middle is a task that gates or counts on a human
but has no AC — that fabricates completion. (The lifecycle rule: an unanswered handoff is `humanPending`,
and a flow is `complete` only when no handoff is left unresolved.)

---

## The Runner

The universal actor-control seam.

The Runner is the one seam through which the system **runs, lists, and stops actors**. It is the agent
graph's control plane: an orchestrator (e.g. the PM) never reaches into `gh`, `termfleet`, Slack, or a
person directly — it calls `run` / `list` / `stop` and the Runner realizes them. This is peer to
[§Capabilities](#capabilities) (authority over the nouns) and [§Task lifecycle](#task-lifecycle) (the work-item state vocabulary).

### The nouns, kept distinct

- **task** — a *work item* (a github issue, a ztrack item). Its lifecycle (`ready`/`in-review`/… —
  [§Task lifecycle](#task-lifecycle)) is a **property of the task**, read by the orchestrator. It is **not** a trigger.
- **actor** — `agent | human` (the IR unit, [§The IR](#the-ir)). What *does* the work.
- **action / run** — *an actor working a task*. The thing you observe "right now" ("a `develop` agent is
  running on #5"; "a `maintainer` approval is pending on #3"). An action is what `list` returns.

### The interface (`packages/core/src/runner.ts`)

All verbs are **async** (return `Promise`s) — a backend may talk to a provider over the network:

```
launch(agent, params?) -> Promise<Session>     # C — start/engage an action; returns a Session
get(id)                -> Promise<Session?>     # R — one
list()                 -> Promise<Session[]>    # R — in-flight
update(id, {status})   -> Promise<boolean>      # U — apply a status transition
cancel(id)             -> Promise<boolean>      # D — stop / retract
```

`Session = { id, agent, status, ref?, params? }`; `params` is opaque pass-through (the runner never
interprets it). Agent realizations may additionally stream logs (a `watch`); human realizations cannot.

Completion is **not the runner's call to invent** — `done` is reached only by an `update` carrying a
**verified** result (an AC + a deterministic and/or AI-judge check), never presumed from a timer or a sent
notification ([§Task lifecycle](#task-lifecycle), "done is verified, not presumed"). Until then a session is `running`; it
may end `cancelled` or `failed`, never silently `done`.

### One interface, realized by (actor kind × substrate)

| realization | launch | list | update / cancel | watch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **agent × github** | `gh workflow run` (workflow_dispatch) | `gh run list` | `gh run cancel` | run logs |
| **agent × local** | termfleet SDK `createAgentWindow` | `snapshot().windows` | `closeWindow` | tail |
| **human × any** | **engage** (record the action; an optional black-box backend notifies a person) | **in-flight asks** | `update` = apply the verified resolution / `cancel` = retract | **— none —** |

The orchestrator calls the same verbs regardless of kind; the actor's `kind` selects the realization (and,
for agents, the substrate selects the backend).

### The human runner is a black box

You cannot *execute* or *watch* a person, so the human realization is the Runner's degenerate twin: it
implements the same `launch`/`get`/`list`/`update`/`cancel` but **has no `watch`** — you can't look over
someone's shoulder; the only progress you ever observe is the **completion boundary**, applied via
`update(id, {status:'done'})` by an authorized verified act (e.g. `/agent approve` gated by `actorRole`, a
native review, or supplied info a check validates). The no-op floor (`HumanRunner` with no `engage`) is pure
**bookkeeping**: `launch` records the parked action and it stays `running` forever — it never sets `done`
itself. How the ask is delivered and the reply detected — Slack, github issue comments, email, an agentic
notifier — is an **opaque, swappable `engage` backend**; the runner only ever exposes the five verbs +
session status, never the channel.

### Consequences

- **`dispatch`** is the IR trigger meaning "this actor is invoked on demand through the Runner" (vs the
  autonomous `cron`/`event` triggers); `kind` picks agent-execution vs human-engagement.
- There is **no `task:` trigger** — `task` is the work item; a lifecycle state is its property, which the
  orchestrator reads when deciding what to `launch`.
- There is **no separate ledger or steward** — the "ledger" is `list()`; the orchestrator (the PM) is the
  single place that launches agents, engages humans, and resumes on either's verified completion, applying
  capacity / retry / backpressure uniformly because every dispatch flows through it.

### Status

- One `Runner` contract (`packages/core/src/runner.ts`): `launch`/`get`/`list`/`update`/`cancel`.
- Agent realizations: `ExecRunner` (reference), Termfleet (local), Github — built + conformance-tested.
- Human realization: `HumanRunner` — **built** as the no-op (bookkeeping) floor that conforms to the same
  contract; a notifying `engage` backend and PM wiring are the `actor-model-human-handoffs` next steps.

## Handoffs

How actors trigger each other (and humans).

> **Status:** design note feeding H1 (`docs/VISION.md`). Grounded in established prior art, not invented.
> Defines how participant-to-participant handoff works in OA, and what is missing to make it explicit,
> typed, and substrate-neutral. Companion to [§The IR](#the-ir), [§Task lifecycle](#task-lifecycle),
> [§Capabilities](#capabilities), and [§Trigger params](#trigger-params).

### The core fact: actors don't trigger each other — they trigger `tasks`

In OA an actor doesn't call another actor. It changes the state of a **task**, and the next actor's
trigger fires on that change. The profile already works this way: PM labels an issue → `developer`'s
trigger fires; `developer` opens a PR → `reviewer`'s trigger fires. Nobody named the developer or the
reviewer; the task state change is the handoff.

This is a named, well-studied model — **choreography** (no central conductor; each participant reacts to
state others leave), implemented as a **blackboard** (participants coordinate through shared state, never
by calling each other), whose formal semantics are a **Petri net** (a token in a place *enables* the next
transition). The task — the issue/PR and its lifecycle — is the token. The work-store you don't need to
invent is just `tasks`, made stateful ([§Task lifecycle](#task-lifecycle)).

Consequence: **OA needs no agent-to-agent messaging, no orchestrator, no new protocol.** Handoffs flow
through the shared, visible `tasks` state, which is also the audit trail. `agent:launch` (the Runner
contract) remains the *orchestration escape hatch* for a direct, named transfer — used sparingly, as PM
already does (a visible command comment for audit + a direct dispatch for reliable delivery).

### The two axes (the whole design space)

Every system studied — microservices, actors, Kanban, workflow engines, classical MAS, LLM frameworks —
sits in a 2×2:

- **Axis A — who decides the next actor: orchestration vs choreography.** Central command to a *named*
  target (visible flow, but coupling / a "god service" risk) vs decentralized reaction to *state/events*
  (decoupled, but the flow is implicit). *(Richardson, Newman, Fowler.)* OA is choreography by default —
  and choreography's usual weakness (invisible flow) does not bite, because the flow lives in visible
  `tasks` and **typing the seams makes the otherwise-implicit graph explicit.**
- **Axis B — who initiates: push vs pull.** Upstream shoves work down (no backpressure; queues blow up as
  utilization → 1, per Little's Law / Kingman) vs downstream *claims* when it has capacity, gated by a
  token. **Pull is the only mode with intrinsic backpressure.** *(Hopp & Spearman, TPS/Kanban.)* OA's
  `maxConcurrent` + `max_open_agent_prs` + PM-sweeps-when-capacity-allows is already pull + WIP limits —
  lean into it as the stability mechanism.

Four archetypes fall out; OA uses two: **choreography + token-enabled** (default, over `tasks`) and
**directed command** (the `agent:launch` escape hatch). For *content*, OA follows the declarative lineage:
**typed task, not whole-context** (Contract Net's announcement, A2A's `Task`, LangGraph's
`Command(update, goto)`) — not the LLM-framework habit of shipping the whole transcript.

### The unit: an actor (agent or human)

A handoff target may be a machine or a person, so the one unit is an **actor** with a `kind`
([§The IR](#the-ir)). The four slots are identical for both:

| slot | `kind: agent` | `kind: human` |
|---|---|---|
| behavior | script / skill | a task spec for a person (situation / decision / result) |
| capabilities | artifact/tasks/agent authority | *same vocabulary* — what the person may do |
| triggers | cron / event / `dispatch` | *same* — the person is `dispatch`ed (engaged on demand) when the orchestrator routes work to them |
| config | timeout, model, … | assignee/candidates, escalation, sla, decision (RACI) |
| realization | substrate runs it (deterministic / model-interpreted) | a real person (prod) or a **simulator** (test); notifies + escalates + blocks until the token is redeemed |

`kind` (the **role**) is **intrinsic and declared** in the profile; *realization* (how the role is filled
— script, model, real person, or a **simulator** in test) is the substrate's/environment's choice. (This
corrects the earlier "human-interpreted = a third execution mode" framing — `human` is a kind;
person/simulator are realizations of it.)

### The seam: a typed edge over the lifecycle

A **seam** is the typed handoff between an upstream actor's output and a downstream actor, mediated by the
orchestrator reading the task lifecycle:

```
upstream actor  ──produces──▶  task enters state S  ──orchestrator reads S──▶  dispatches the downstream actor
```

The seam carries a typed payload — validated by the structured-handoff research (clinical SBAR / I-PASS):

- **in** — what the upstream presents (situation + background + assessment).
- **decision** — what is asked (the RACI/DACI type: do-the-work / decide / approve / consult / inform).
- **out** — what is returned to resume, **with receiver confirmation** (I-PASS "synthesis by receiver":
  the handoff is not complete until the receiver confirms — a closed loop).

For agent→agent, the producing side is often implicit today (the behavior sets the state); typing it
explicitly is later work (the seam graph that the twin reads). For the human seam it is essential.

### The human seam = the same seam + four affordances

Triggering a human is triggering an actor **plus** the things humans need because they have unbounded
latency and no polling loop. Each maps to a clean piece of prior art:

1. **Durable, indefinite pause + redeem handle** — the flow blocks until the human redeems a token.
   *Analog: AWS Step Functions `waitForTaskToken` / Temporal Signals.*
2. **A worklist they pull from + a push path** — offer-to-many → claim. *Analog: BPM candidate-group +
   claim / Camunda external-task fetch-and-lock; van der Aalst resource patterns (offer vs allocate,
   push vs pull).*
3. **An escalation policy** — notify → ack-or-timeout → escalate → rotate to whoever is on-call now →
   repeat. Two axes: escalate if not **acknowledged**, re-trigger if not **resolved**. *Analog: PagerDuty
   / Opsgenie escalation policies.*
4. **A structured payload + closed loop** — the seam's `in`/`decision`/`out` + receiver confirmation.
   *Analog: SBAR / I-PASS; RACI/DACI for the decision type.*

The seam is identical; the `kind: human` realization adds these. A2A's `input-required` task state is the
model for "needs more info mid-task," including when that info comes from a person.

### Testing actors / simulating humans

An org with human actors must be testable **without** real humans — otherwise the Bench leg can't run on
any realistic org (autonomy ratio < 100% always). So human simulation is a *precondition* for Bench, not a
convenience. The actor model makes it work because the **seam is the substitution boundary**: anything
that honors a seam can fill the role. The *same profile* runs in production with people and in a testbed
with **simulators** — only the substrate's *realization* of `kind: human` actors differs (realization is
the substrate's/environment's concern, not the profile's).

Three properties make a human actor simulatable, and the design already provides them:

- **A typed, machine-producible payload.** A simulator must consume `in` and produce `out`. A free-form
  prose handoff is not simulatable — so testability is an *independent* reason the seam payload is typed
  (`in`/`decision`/`out`), not just human-readable.
- **A redeem handle decoupled from identity.** The flow blocks on a token *anyone holding it* can redeem
  (the Step Functions `waitForTaskToken` model). A person or a simulator resumes the flow identically.
- **Realization supplied by the environment.** The testbed is a test realization of the substrate; it
  supplies simulators for `kind: human` actors via a testbed-level fixtures file (`actor → simulated
  behavior`). The profile stays environment-agnostic.

Human simulators come in tiers, by use:

- **Fixture** — deterministic ("maintainer approves after 1h unless the diff touches workflows"); for
  reproducible proof/unit tests.
- **Distributional** — samples latency + approve/reject from a distribution; feeds the **twin** (which
  needs distributions, not averages).
- **Model-roleplay** — a model plays the role per a persona/rubric; for rich bench scenarios.

Simulators are **calibrated from real human-seam measurements** (H3), and the twin↔testbed division
applies to humans too: the **simulator is the cheap screen; the real human in dogfood is the ground
truth** that calibrates it. Two cautions: an *optimistic/uncalibrated* human sim yields fitness numbers
that don't reflect reality (same trap as averages-not-distributions); and optimizing an org against a
predictable simulator invites **Goodhart** (designs that exploit the sim). So: sims for screening,
real-human dogfood for truth.

This is distinct from hand-driving the autonomy: a deterministic simulator *substitutes a human input* so
the autonomy runs unattended and reproducibly — it does not drive the autonomy. A deterministic sim is in
fact *better* for measurement validity than a real operator, which would contaminate the run.

### What changes (and what doesn't)

**Doesn't change** — the mechanism is already right: choreography through `tasks`; `agent:launch` as the
escape hatch; `maxConcurrent`/`max_open_agent_prs` as pull/WIP backpressure; the four-slot unit, the
capability model, the trust/wrapper split.

**The real delta** — the substrate-coupled, untyped part is the *trigger* (today it names raw github
events: `event: issues`, `pull_request_target`). The changes make the handoff edge portable, typed, and
give the human edge a declared consumer:

1. **`tasks` lifecycle catalog** — state vocabulary the orchestrator reads ([§Task lifecycle](#task-lifecycle)). *Additive.*
2. **The `dispatch` trigger form** — an actor invoked on demand through the Runner (`{ dispatch: true; params? }`);
   `cron` + `dispatch` are the portable kinds, `event:` stays as the escape hatch. The orchestrator (PM)
   reads a task's state and `launch`es the matching actor — no substrate watches task state.
3. **The actor model** — `kind: agent | human` on the unit; `kind` declared, not inferred. The
   `kind: human` realization (worklist + escalation + durable-pause + payload) is the main new substrate
   build.
4. **Migrate `human_required` from a risk flag to a declared consumer** — `policy.box.risk.*` stays the
   *producer rule* that transitions a task to `human-required`; add a `maintainer` actor of `kind: human`
   that the orchestrator `dispatch`es when it reads that state, whose `out` (approve/reject, confirmed)
   resumes the merge gate. The side-effect becomes an explicit, typed handoff.

**Later (H4, the twin):** declare the *producing* side too, so the seam graph is explicit and measurable.

### The forks

1. Keep `event:` as a substrate-native escape hatch (recommended — partial support is first-class), with
   `cron` + `dispatch` as the portable path.
2. Payload *content* lives in the human behavior spec (opaque, like every behavior); only the `decision`
   *type* surfaces as a config key so the substrate routes approve vs consult vs inform.
3. *Holding* and reconciling task state (H2) and the producing-side seam graph (H4) are separate, later
   horizons — H1 needs only the lifecycle *vocabulary* + the `dispatch` trigger + the `kind: human` actor.

### Incremental proof

The `maintainer` actor ships as a `dispatch` `kind: human` actor: the orchestrator (PM) reads the
`human-required` state off a task and `launch`es the maintainer — the same portable seam on every
substrate (the `human` realization — worklist + escalation + durable-pause — is the new build). No
github-label-watching trigger is involved; task state is a property the orchestrator reads, not an event.

### Durable scheduled workspace identity

A durable singleton owns one workspace across ticks. Resolve its canonical workspace before allocating a checkout; active skips and continuations reuse the original generation and lease. Unknown launches, missing generation ownership and ambiguous legacy conversations refuse a replacement. Serialize singleton ticks before workspace selection. Scheduler deadlines are durable before spawning a job, so restart observes the retry/interval deadline rather than duplicating work. Proposal commits carry exact branch, agent and session completion attestations for adopter reconciliation.
