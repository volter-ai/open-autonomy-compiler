> Documentation for **open-autonomy v0.4** — the doc-version marker (machine-checked by
> `bun run check:release-consistency`). npm `0.4.0`/`0.4.1` are known-broken on `compile` (OA-01/F-1);
> install `0.4.2+` once published. Older docs: read them at their version tag, e.g. `blob/v0.4.0/`.

`open-autonomy` makes a repository drive its own maintenance work: work items become reviewed,
gated, merged changes, produced by bounded AI agents under **deterministic guardrails**.
It is **substrate-agnostic** — the same setup compiles onto **GitHub Actions** or onto a **local**
machine loop. The repo also runs open-autonomy against itself (it's its own first user).

**Want to run it on your own repo?** Jump to [**Run it on your repo**](#run-it-on-your-repo) — two
independent axes (**runner**: GitHub Actions or your machine; **code host**: GitHub PRs+auto-merge or a
local-git board), so three setups: fully hosted, **local agents → auto-merging GitHub PRs**, or fully
local (closed-source, no GitHub).

## The model

You write a **profile** (a recipe) and **compile** it onto a **substrate**, producing an
**installation** you run:

```
compile(profile, substrate) → installation
```

- **profile** — a substrate-agnostic recipe: which agents (skills), which workflows, which policy —
  expressed as an IR (`autonomy.ir.v1`).
- **substrate** — *where/how* it runs = a **trigger executor** (fires workflows) + a **runner**
  (runs agents), over a **box** (the agent's POSIX environment). `github` and `local` are peers.
- **installation** — the materialized files laid into a repo for one substrate.

Each agent is a **credentialed job** whose token is scoped to its capabilities; it acts directly
(edits code, pushes a branch, opens an auto-merging PR). The merge boundary is a **permission split**:
no single agent holds both `code:review` (statuses:write — blesses) and `code:propose` (contents:write
— pushes), so none can both write code and bless it. GitHub native auto-merge lands a PR once `ci` +
`agent-review` are both green. The agent gets bounded model access (no raw keys) and can never merge.
(This scoped-token enforcement is the **hosted** substrate; on a local runner the agents share your token —
your CI + supervision are the boundary. See [`OPERATIONS.md`](./docs/OPERATIONS.md#local-install-checklist).)

Read [`docs/SPEC.md`](./docs/SPEC.md) for the full model and conformance contract, and
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the vocabulary and layout.

## Run it on your repo

Two **independent** choices (a profile compiles to any valid combination — install with one `npx`
command, no clone required):

- **Runner** — *where agents execute*: **GitHub Actions** (hosted jobs) or **local** (your machine,
  via [termfleet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/termfleet), using your own logged-in Claude Code / Codex).
- **Code host** — *where code lives and how it merges*: **GitHub** (the agent opens a PR; CI + an
  `agent-review` status gate **native auto-merge** — the reviewer is independently *enforced* on the hosted
  runner; on a local runner the agents share your token, so your CI is the real gate) or **local-git** (a
  tracker on disk, PR-free — no GitHub).

The runner is orthogonal to the code host: you can run agents on your own machine and still land
auto-merging PRs on GitHub. Three setups people actually use:

| Setup | Runner | Code host | Profile | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Hosted** | GitHub Actions | GitHub | `self-driving` (new/dedicated repo) or `simple-gh-sdlc` (your existing repo) | public/team repos — fully autonomous in the cloud, `/agent` issue-comment control, a bounded model-token proxy |
| **Local agents, GitHub PRs** | local | GitHub | `simple-gh-sdlc` | run the agents on *your* machine/IP & your own model subscription, but still get PRs + native auto-merge on GitHub |
| **Fully local** | local | local-git | `simple-sdlc` | closed-source — no GitHub at all; work comes from a local `ztrack` board, PR-free |

> **`self-driving` is a whole-repo SCAFFOLD, not an overlay** — it carries README.md/package.json/
> `.gitignore` as resources (this repo's own dogfood setup). Compiling it into a directory with existing,
> different copies of those files makes those replacements explicit in the candidate commit. Adopting into an **existing**
> repo? Use `simple-gh-sdlc` / `simple-sdlc` / `hello` instead — they're purely additive (see the overlay
> note in [`OPERATIONS.md`](./docs/OPERATIONS.md#install--operate)).

```bash
cd my-repo

# Hosted, NEW/dedicated repo (GitHub Actions runner, GitHub code host, whole-repo scaffold):
npx open-autonomy compile self-driving gh-actions .   # then wire repo vars/secrets + branch protection

# Hosted, EXISTING repo (GitHub Actions runner, GitHub code host, additive overlay):
npx open-autonomy compile simple-gh-sdlc gh-actions .  # generates no package.json/README/.gitignore

# Local agents → GitHub PRs (local runner, GitHub code host) — step 3 of the checklist below:
npx open-autonomy compile simple-gh-sdlc local .       # agents on your machine; PRs auto-merge on GitHub

# Fully local (local runner, local-git code host) — step 3 of the checklist below:
npx open-autonomy compile simple-sdlc local .          # no GitHub; or `hello` for a zero-tracker demo
```

For a Git repository, `compile` never writes those files into the working tree. The worktree must be
completely clean; OA builds one candidate commit in an isolated worktree and prints its complete diff.
After the installing agent reviews that exact SHA, accept it separately:

```bash
open-autonomy accept <full-candidate-sha> --target .
```

Acceptance refuses if the worktree became dirty or `HEAD` moved. `--force` and the old upgrade `--apply`
overwrite path cannot bypass this boundary. Compiling to a non-Git directory remains a build-output mode,
not a repository installation.

> **The two `local` lines above are a teaser, not an entry point — they're step 3 of 8 in the ordered
> checklist.** Don't start here on a real repo: deps, sign-in, and the termfleet ports/pin come first.
> Follow the full checklist end to end →
> [**`docs/OPERATIONS.md#local-install-checklist`**](./docs/OPERATIONS.md#local-install-checklist).

> **One-command local install — `oa install`.** `bin/install.ts` (the `open-autonomy install` verb, alias
> `oa install`) chains the **entire** flow above into one command: detect → select → direction → authorize
> → execute → validate → hand-off → prove-advancing, pausing at the human gates plus a mandatory
> installing-agent review of the complete candidate commit and printing exactly which flag to add to
> resume. It's the recommended path for the **local** runner once you've cloned this repo:
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/volter-ai/open-autonomy && cd open-autonomy
> bun bin/install.ts /path/to/your-repo --pick simple-gh-sdlc --substrate local --owner-repo <owner>/<repo>
> # review the complete diff it prints, then repeat with:
> bun bin/install.ts /path/to/your-repo <same-options> --accept <full-candidate-sha>
> # or fully local, no GitHub at all:
> bun bin/install.ts /path/to/your-repo --pick simple-sdlc --substrate local
> ```
> It calls the exact manual commands above and below **internally** (`compile`, the candidate commit, branch-
> protection provisioning, …) — the manual paths remain valid and are what `oa install` itself calls into;
> use them directly for fine-grained control over any one step, or read
> [`docs/INSTALL-AGENT.md`](./docs/INSTALL-AGENT.md) for the phase-by-phase reference `bin/install.ts`
> implements. `bun bin/install.ts --help` lists every gate-answer flag.
>
> **Honest caveat — source-checkout only today:** the *published* `npx open-autonomy install` / `oa
> install` looks for `bin/install.ts` in the current working directory (i.e. you must run it from inside a
> source checkout of this repo); that file is dev-time-only monorepo tooling and is
> never bundled into the npm tarball, so it exits `1` with an explicit "clone the repo" message instead of
> silently doing less than advertised (verified live: `node dist/cli.js install --help` outside this
> checkout prints exactly that and exits 1). Until it ships in a release, use it via the clone above; the
> plain `npx`, no-clone `compile` commands above remain the only no-clone install path today.

Full step-by-step for the **hosted** GitHub Actions runner (repo vars/secrets, branch protection) →
[**`docs/OPERATIONS.md`**](./docs/OPERATIONS.md#github-production-rollout). `self-driving` and
`simple-gh-sdlc` run on **either** runner; `simple-sdlc` is local-git (no code host). See
[the CLI](#the-open-autonomy-cli) for all verbs and options.

> **Installing with an agent?** Point it at
> [**`docs/INSTALL-AGENT.md`**](./docs/INSTALL-AGENT.md) — a guided **detect → ask → execute → verify**
> playbook: it reads your repo, asks you only the judgment calls (the merge gate, identity, the first
> issue), runs the overlay, and proves the loop merges a PR before calling it done.

## What it does (the GitHub substrate)

```text
issue or PM sweep -> develop (a credentialed skill agent, bounded model token)
  -> the agent edits code + opens its own PR with auto-merge queued
  -> CI + an independent reviewer post the required `ci` + `agent-review` statuses
  -> GitHub native auto-merge lands it (no agent can merge), or human-required escalation
```

(The scoped-token reviewer independence above is the **hosted** substrate; a local runner runs the same
loop with the agents on your token — see [`OPERATIONS.md`](./docs/OPERATIONS.md#local-install-checklist).)

Operators steer it with `/agent` issue comments (see Commands). The `local` substrate runs the same
loop with a scheduler loop + a termfleet runner instead of GitHub Actions.

## Repository layout

**The engine** — substrate-agnostic, reusable (`packages/`):

- `packages/core` — the IR, the **Runner contract**, the conformance battery, the compiler framework.
- `packages/substrate-local` — the **local** substrate: emit a local-loop installation + the termfleet runner.
- `packages/substrate-github` — the **github** substrate: emit the manifest + workflows + operator control plane + the github runner.
- `bin/autonomy-conformance.ts` — check any runner against the core contract.

**The GitHub app** — open-autonomy running on the github substrate (the complete, dogfooded substrate today):

- `scripts/` — the github runtime: the model-proxy mint/exchange/revoke clients, the credentialed skill runner (`scripts/claude-agent-run.ts`), the operator control handler (`.github/agent-control.mjs`), `runner.ts`, and the preflight/proof-audit tooling. Each agent is a skill run by Claude Code under a capability-scoped token.
- `volter-ai/open-autonomy (the platform repo)` — a Cloudflare Worker that mints bounded, revocable model tokens (no raw keys) and meters spend against a sponsor-funded budget ledger.
- `.open-autonomy/`, `.codex/skills/`, `.github/workflows/` — this repo's own installation (the dogfood).

**Recipes & demos:**

- `profiles/` — profiles (recipes) that compile to a runner × code host: `hello` (minimal),
  `self-driving` (open-autonomy's own dogfood; gh-actions + local), `simple-gh-sdlc` (generic
  GitHub-code-host SDLC; gh-actions + local), `simple-gh` (local Manager/Planner/Kaizen with human
  roadmap triage), and `simple-sdlc` (fully-local, PR-free).

Docs: [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) (the github app's design + trust boundaries + canonical vocabulary + layout),
[`SPEC.md`](./docs/SPEC.md) (the substrate-agnostic model + the four catalogs),
[`ROADMAP.md`](./docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Develop on open-autonomy itself

This is **contributor setup** — clone this repo to hack on open-autonomy. You do **not** need it to
*use* open-autonomy on your own repo (for that, see [Run it on your repo](#run-it-on-your-repo)).

```bash
bun install
bun run check                  # typecheck + conformance + tests (proxy + runtime + examples)
bun run autonomy conformance exec   # check the Runner contract on the reference runner
```

## The `open-autonomy` CLI

One command is the front door — `open-autonomy <verb>` (alias `oa`):

```bash
open-autonomy compile <profileName|profileDir> <local|gh-actions> [outDir] [--force]  # --force is build-output-only; Git targets always produce a reviewed candidate
open-autonomy accept <full-candidate-sha> [--target <git-worktree>]       # accept exactly what the installing agent reviewed
open-autonomy lint <profileDir>                                          # validate a profile of your own — writes nothing
open-autonomy preflight                                                  # make an adopter repo install-ready (run after installing the runner deps)
open-autonomy conformance <exec|termfleet|gh-actions>                    # run the substrate conformance battery ("github" still accepted)
open-autonomy upgrade --profile <dir> --target <dir> --substrate local|gh-actions [--prune] # prepare and print one reviewed upgrade candidate
```

The first argument is a **bundled profile name** (`self-driving`, `simple-gh-sdlc`, `simple-sdlc`, `hello` — shipped with the
package) or a path to your own profile dir. `open-autonomy` **is published** ([npmjs.com/package/open-autonomy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/open-autonomy)) —
no clone required: `npx open-autonomy <verb>` (or `bunx open-autonomy <verb>`). The published package is a
self-contained Node bundle, so plain Node works; bun is not required to *use* it. From a clone (bun-native,
runs TypeScript directly): `bun run autonomy <verb>` or `bun bin/open-autonomy.ts <verb>`. The published
bundle is produced by `bun run build`.

To adopt open-autonomy into your own repo, compile a profile into it — see
[**Run it on your repo**](#run-it-on-your-repo) for the runner ⟂ code-host setups and the follow-up
guides ([`OPERATIONS.md`](./docs/OPERATIONS.md#github-production-rollout) for the GitHub Actions runner,
[`OPERATIONS.md`](./docs/OPERATIONS.md#local-install-checklist) for the local runner). From a clone, a
profile *path* also works: `open-autonomy compile profiles/self-driving gh-actions ../my-repo`.

## Operator commands

These are the **GitHub code host's** control plane (issue comments). On a local-git board you steer the
fleet with termfleet directly and the tracker instead — see
[`docs/OPERATIONS.md`](./docs/OPERATIONS.md#local-install-checklist).

Operator commands work only for maintainers (repo OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR); a comment from anyone
else is ignored. To launch an agent by comment, name it: `/agent <agent>` (the workflow name).

- `/agent develop` — ask the developer to work on the issue.
- `/agent reviewer` — run the reviewer on an agent PR.
- `/agent pause` / `/agent resume` — pause or resume issue-level work (the `agent-paused` label).
- `/agent status` — comment the recent runs of that agent's workflow.
- `/agent retry` — relaunch this issue's agent workflow after a failed check on its agent PR (a
  fresh run, fresh model spend); reports when there is nothing to retry.
- `/agent cancel` — cancel active workflow runs (proxy run slots are not revoked; they expire at
  token TTL, ~2h).
- `/agent approve <full-head-sha>` — authorize that exact PR head for the `human-approval` gate. This is
  equivalent for that status to a native maintainer Approve and works when GitHub forbids approving your
  own PR. A profile may separately require native GitHub reviews (for example, SOC 2 separation of duties).
- `/agent decide <decision>` / `/agent answer <answer>` — resolve a `human-required` / `needs-info` item:
  records your decision/answer and clears the block so the PM re-triages and resumes (the human seam's `out`).

**Repo-wide kill switch** (not an `/agent` verb): set the repository variable
`PUBLIC_AGENT_REPO_PAUSED=true` (`gh variable set PUBLIC_AGENT_REPO_PAUSED --body true`) — every
agent job skips while it is set; clear it to resume the fleet.

## Security

open-autonomy runs semi-untrusted agents and operates a model-token/funding proxy. See
[`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for the trust model and **private** vulnerability reporting. Provided
AS-IS (Apache-2.0, no warranty) — if you deploy it, you own the secrets, spend, and access you grant.

## Why a funding platform lives here

`volter-ai/open-autonomy (the platform repo)` is what makes autonomous runs safe and affordable: it mints bounded,
revocable model tokens so untrusted agent jobs get model access without raw provider keys, and meters
spend against a sponsor-funded budget. It is infrastructure for the agent loop, not a separate product.

## Commercial boundary

`open-autonomy` is the OSS implementation. `volter-autonomy` can build on it as a paid hosted product
with managed proxy infrastructure, dashboards, org policy, and support.
